2017--01,zhee z,Jalan Malioboro is the heart of Yogyakarta city. It's not complete to Yogyakarta if you haven't been to Jalan Malioboro and take photos there. Every day this road is always visited a lot by locals and tourists alike. Here is a very cheap traditional market by selling various
2017--01,jolienp773,We stayed at 'the packers lodge' in one of the small streets next to Malioboro. It was nice to be close to the busiest street in Yogya. But it was also nice to leave the busy street for some time. It's nice to take the atmosphere in and to look at the many souvenirs you can buy
2017--01,Intrepidwonderlust,We decided to wonder down the road from our hotel.   The street has a loaded with people and there were bands and people cooking food.   There were lots of local shops selling a variety of boutique goods and batik.   If you walk to the end of the road you find the traditional
2017--01,cinbkk,If you like big (local) crowds lots of cheap clothes street artists and food this is the place to go. The biggest crowds gather around the street signs as it's apparently a must-have location for a selfie. Together with Alun Alun Selatan one of the few lively places after

2017--01,Explore449844,We went today - Sunday before new year. Very busy and crowded. Lots of batik clothes and t-shirts skirts souvenirs. Street food was good to try. Lots of variety. Biggest difficulty was getting a taxi or grab back to our hotel. Traffic too congested to get a ride. Had to walk
2017--01,AAFK,The street is crowded due to holiday season. Having breakfast at Pasar Beringharjo but wrong choice because the price is expensive for a normal street food.
2017--01,Abdul Hanif Arromy,I had gone to Malioboro Street after from Borobudur Temple. In Malioboro Street I can visit the Hamzah Batik and see the batik in there.
2016--01,Viviyani,Holiday season like Christmas brings too many people to Jogjakarta such as Malioboro street especially. We didn't have a chance to enjoy our authentic Javanese dinner along Malioboro street. At last we went back andwe had pizza  beside the hotel that we stayed in.
2017--01,Fajar Maulana H,We're here on 23rd December 2018 it takes 2 hours from our Hotel (Grand Ambarrukmo) to go to this road because it's a peak season....The location is full of people food street a lot of batik and local accessories store and street stall but that's all...nothing really special
2017--01,Richoid,If you're a westerner unless you're in the market for some Indonesian clothing or pastries there's not much here you're going to want to buy. Watching the endless streams of locals walking up and down the street gets old after about 20 minutes. There's also a mall that sells

2017--01,Elnora,Famous street. So we went there to buy batik and souvenirs. There are so many choices and you just have to pick what you like. Two type of vintage transportation. Becak and Horse. But i pity the horse. It looks tired. And also the old man with his Becak. Didn't have enough time
2017--01,H1tgurl,This place is a haven for those who love to bargain. I’m not a haggler so I found it too busy and the prices start at ridiculous levels so it’s not my choice of location.
2017--01,David,Maliboro Road is not interesting because of the shops: as other reviewers have highlighted there isn't actually that much variety between them (they sell clothes knick-knacks and street food). What makes the road interesting is the bustling atmosphere. People all over the place

2017--01,Johanes S,Not much we can say..but its a must to visit. Cause this just like one of an Jogja iconic place. If Singapore have orchard tokyo have shibuya..maybe Jogja have Malioboro. The street where all the crowd is here..mix with traditional and modern aspect. There.is andong and

2016--01,Chantal v,We don’t mean to be negative about this place but Malioboro road is nothing more than just a crowded street. Not much to see here. Unless you’re a big fan of crowded stalls of the same batik shirts there is no need to really see it.
2017--01,Dinanti E,Malioboro street is one of the attractive traditional shopping centre in Jogja. you may find certain of things here but you will find mostly clothes (tshirt batik pants batik sandals). I am very enjoying the ambiance street seller but for me I prefer to buy in other place

2017--01,mrsau2015,We took a grab car from Grand Aston Hotel to Malioboro road Rs18k. Not worth visiting mainly locals walking around. Not conducive to walk as the walkway really bad with smelly drains dusty and congested with locals selling satay on the floor. The mall is ok and you can have
2017--01,ombun r,This Jogja street is not only a paradise for traveller but it is the actual paradise for street seller namely kaki lima. Those sellers contribute positively to strengthen all culture products such batik and incomes of Jogja. Soon Padang will be like that one.....🙃

2017--01,mwhzzi,This road seems to go for ever and most interesting is that you can buy clothes and clothes and clothes etc. etc. as far as the eye can see it seems. You wouldn’t want to be a clothing trader with a million other competitors either side of you. Magnificently crazy!
2017--01,Tony P,A great street full of local life and colour. Nobody could regret spending time walking along this busy shopping street even if you have absolutely no intention to buy anything the chances are you'll find something that tempts an opening of your wallet or purse to bag a
2017--01,Chloesworld_7,If your staying in Jogja it's worth a trip to see this market.  Although most of it is the same (batik and souvenirs) it's a good atmosphere.  There were stalls selling coffee and bands playing when we went which was quite nice.

2016--01,Tohmatohs,We had high expectations of this area since it is like a backpacker’s Street. However most of the shops were like a copy of each other selling the same type of clothings and accessories.   The side of the road selling food was boring as every shops sold the same food. There
2016--01,OTIS W,During my stay in Yogyakarta shopping in Jalan Malioboro becomes a habitual activity. I frequently pay visits at two different periods : one is in the morning from 10 to 11 a.m. and the other falls from 7 to 9 p.m. The whole area is usually sardine-packed with tourists they

2016--01,Gunjan Barua,The city Yogyakarta is famous for Indonesian Batiks and the Malioboro street stays at the core of the Batic fabrics. It's a typical example of Asian city with full of chaos and flooded with street shops. The prices are really affordable and you are bound to get your expected

2016--01,Alexlc211,Not a lot of true craft here. Very touristy and most. Of the product looked like it was manufactured. There are a few legit shops hidden among the crowds and peddlers.
2016--01,Dave H,Lots of guidebooks say it’s a happening place but I don’t see the attraction.  Lots of stalls and shops but only worth seeing if you are nearby.
2016--01,Lynns98816,Malioboro is known as an iconic street of Jogja. Lots of stores and stalls sell clothes and souvenirs. The price is not cheap enough and we have to bargain.  Due to Jogja's weather we suggest you to use hat while strolling around this street.

2016--01,ankyfire,If you wanted to buy souvenirs that's where you want to go. They have everything you might need and you don't have to look through merchandise in every shop as most of them carry almost exactly the same items. It's not a must see but who doesn't buy gifts for friends? And
2015--01,Audrey D,It was crowded and the shops all sell the same things. I really did not like it and suggest you better go to another part of town to shop for souvenirs. It was also difficult to find a taxi there.
2016--01,Ivo,Street you cannot miss if you are in Yogya. The amount of stalls and items sold here are truly unbelievable. There are so many clothes in huge piles of plastic wrappings.   It’s very busy and huge. At night it as at least as busy.
2016--01,Jackoism,I’m not sure whether it’s due to weekend or Saturday it’s seems like a nite market. Place where you can find souvenirs and batik.. almost 80% of the stalls or shops selling batik. Besides there is lots of local and authentic foods along the street. A must visit place when you

2016--01,Kah Hoo L,This is a one-stop-centre to acquire local handicraft especially the batiks. However it is only good to visit once only as the merchandises sold are repeating in each stores. Most of the prices are fixed so you can forget on bargaining!
2016--01,Anna_June_2011,A shopping spree with a bargaining power needed badly here. Use your ability to choose the good stuffs and bargain it start with half price of it!

2016--01,AlinaRL,Crazy place with mostly clothes and some food stalls. You realise fairly quickly that they are more or less the same rather poor quality. Crowded with locals in the evening. Big shop Mirota Batik is good for buying souvenirs.

2015--01,Chrys,I always visited this place whenever I went to Jogja because you cannot say you've been to Jogja if you haven't been to Malioboro. The place is much better and comfortable compared to years ago but the street was under construction so there was a mess but didn't really disturb

2015--01,Micheal H,So many different shops and items to look at. I recommend going earlier in the morning as it gets crowded an if your not used to the climate in Yogyakarta it begins to get hot near mid day. Very interesting to see all the handmade goods. Great prices on many things also.
2016--01,manucanuck,From fashion to souvenir you can find everything along the malioboro street there are street food and performance from noon onwards. Don't expect a clean street people smoked like chimneys and there were roaches every 4 streets apart.

2016--01,David H,Jalan Maliboro is quintisenntially yogya... Yogya is a tourist uni and historical town and Maliboro is all that and more. Endless batik shops crowd the sides of the street as a seemingly endless streams of cars roll by day and night with tourists staring out at tourists
2016--01,Yunita,Malioboro is one of must visit place in Yogyakarta. They sell many of traditional souvernirs such as tshirt bracellet keychain bakpia and batik. When i visited there there was roadwork to make the sidewalk wider.
2016--01,Vivien S,Malioboro is a wonderful place but BE AWARE of batik art gallery scammers who politely start talking to you on the main street then gently invite you to a 'university batik exhibition that closes today' and then get more and more pushy as time goes by - by the end they don't
2015--01,icmbs,I didn't enjoy my time in Jl Malioboro. Every stall pretty much sold exactly the same things; batiks and souvenirs. There were many food stalls that sold the same foods too. It was very busy and I didn't feel safe walking through and had to give my bag to my husband.

2015--01,Nomad_AAA,In summary this place is 'tourist trap galore'. The street is incredibly crowded and dirty and you really just have vendors selling the exact same thing over and over again as you walk down the road. My friend and I honestly did not feel incredibly safe and there were obviously

2015--01,Micheltravel,Close to the Kraton another thing you need to avoid unless you are a real tourist shopping for bargains you will never use.   Malioboro Road and market are the real tourist trap. Spend you time somewhere nice rather than here. Only good things around Yogja are Borobudur
2015--01,MsKelo,You can really find everything in here. The street itself is bursting with vendors and you can hackle yourself great beachwear and not too serious jewellery and bags and so on. There are also some hidden gems amongst the real shops. Beautiful and original designs instead the
2015--01,Antontam,Famous street in Yogyakarta about 1 km street with big pedestrian walk. Along the pedestrian walk there has many stall of local souvenir handicrafts and local food. This place will be crowded at weekend. We stay at hotel near malioboro street every morning we walk through
2015--01,Tony A,Every time we visit Jogja I make sure that we have a couple of days and nights to visit Jalan Malioboro. The street is a wonder! Vibrant colourful and overflowing with great bargains. Every time we vivit we buy Christmas gifts for all of the children in our Pencak Silat club
2015--01,Myo M,About a half-hour walk from one end to the other this street really is the place in the city for souvenir shopping (from these make-shift vendors along the sidewalk on both sides of the street) and to get that feeling of festiveness (which you'll get not just by walking

2015--01,Paul v,Cool place. Always crowded with locals. Lot of hawkers if you wanna try some new.  Lot of people never seen european's before. Kind of funny
2014--01,sammy260,Visited Malioboro street in the late afternoon of a weekday and it was very crowded. Everything from food to materia was quite overpriced. Everyone selling just the exact same stuff so no unique discoveries really made here. Lots of hassle and a really cheap feeling to the
2015--01,413flavias,The road is undergoing renovation to became a pedestrian only so very dust and heavy traffic.  No particular interest. We did not want to shop so just stoped for lunch.

2015--01,email m,Beautiful place  friendly people many souvenir we can get for example clothe bag watch. You can take Becak for it.
2015--01,kjell m,The area is only 100 meter from where we stay to it is nice. Here you have eveything you want or need but it all looks similar

2015--01,Dee,This is a very busy stretch of roads during anytime of the day and night. A very nice money changer is located at the Tugu Monument end. Pls carry your passport to exchange money. Banks will NOT allow money exchange unless you have an account with them.  There is a railway
2015--01,JD1316,Full of shops mainly selling batik and 1 tired looking old mall. No food options really unless you are looking for local and street food. Would suggest visiting it for local flavour and also if you want to buy souvenirs. Half the road is dug up so walking is quite treacherous.
2015--01,fredericoldrich,To busy with locals full of small shops on the midlemof the way people.pushing.you  and horses everywhere smell disgusting because the hot last days toguether with the animals defrctions make the trip unforgettable.

2015--01,Mariaangeles2016,The first time I visited it I hated it. As the days went by I became reconciled with the city its crazy traffic and the vendors of batik. Now I regret not having spent more time in the incredible spice market...
2015--01,Lodian D,Malioboro street so different like some years ago. We can't find horse (andong) and others. Some public infrastructure will build behind street
2015--01,vidzgandy,Unfortunately this place has lost its charm .. previously this street was excellent now it has been ruined .. honestly the side streets and cafes behind malioboro are excellent .. full of excellent surprises.. thoroughly recommend walking around the back streets
2015--01,Jignesh P,Went to Malioboro for souvenirs. Almost all the shops sold identical items. A bit crowded and repetitive for my liking.
2015--01,shahrizaton,Selling all the same souvenir stuff but different prices. Worth spending some time surveying before buying.
2014--01,Marie 玛丽 J,All shopping stalls are pretty much the same and the souvenirs are not very interesting (except if you are looking for Batik). We were looking for a nice restaurant or bar to sit and relax but it is only local food stalls. I would also recommend to go in the evening coz we went
2014--01,apporters,Great place to look for local travel souvenirs and it it's worth to try. It’s fun to visit bit not for more than 20-30 minutes or so.

,Umi Rukailah Safari,It is  best to stroll around window shopping. You may want to try lumpia at the corner of Hotel Mutiara. And drink Ronde at the corner of  Malioboro Mall. To get good stuff of souvenirs is Hamzah Batik at the end of the Malioboro street across Pasar Bringharjo is the best place
2014--01,jendela79,We came here for the atmosphere and the shopping.  The people are all so lovely and there are so many places to stop when you need a break from the hustle and bustle. Souvenirs were plentiful just shop around before you buy.  Sometimes the shops had things cheaper than on the

2014--01,DSS88,Its very crowded during night time with the project still undergoing. You must mastered the skill of bargaining to be able to buy something here. A street itself is quite dirty (probably because it is very crowded with a lot of tourist) but its a must go when you visit Jogja.
,bernie47801,I love Malioboro for all that it offers. You can stroll from one end to the other or use horse or pedal powered transport from a bygone era. Museums shopping complexes and a small Chinatown area can be found. My favourite batik store is a must visit location every time I come

2008--01,havegutwilltravel,Several times being to Jogjakarta but have little times strolling the street of maliborou. Managed to see a lot of attractions and activities along the street. Other than visiting other places in Jogjakarta do not forget maliborou street. Full of attractions charming and lively
,Elisabeth S,Its a shopping paradise. So many little shops but most of them sell actually the same stuff. You have to bargain a lot -  and I mean really a lot because they charge you more than double the price. visit the pasar close to malioboro road!
2007--01,lannuevas,There are many food stalls and souvenir shops. If you visit Yogyakarta then you should visit the street. It has pedestrian side now so even if you just want to have sight seeing
2006--01,FaizPiperdy,Shops after shops of batik and handicrafts can be found here. Try to go for the shops around the middle of the street for better quality stuff. Many food stalls line the street as well for authentic Indonesian food so take your pick as you will be spoiled for choice. It was

2004--01,Rohliana L,Malioboro is the place that you should! Visit when you are traveling in yogyakarta. I prefer better visit it on evening so you can see every angklung bands. Angklung is traditional indonesian musik.

2002--01,hemuhemu19,Just crowded when high season. There's nothing special with this place. You can buy souvenir around Malioboro street. It's only a landmark of Yogyakarta city.
,Adhitya S,The best hangout in Yogyakarta. While sightseeing over the street we can also buy some traditional souvenirs and outfits at shops besides the road. Also don't worry if we get starving since traditional foods also sold by so many merchants there.
2001--01,Ravichandra1,Head to Malioboro if you want bargains for souveniers!  Dont forget to visit batik shop Hamzah Batik for everything on batik plus others. They have demos on how batik is made too!

,howdy99,Interesting time if you have it... This place has whatever you want. Some of the quality is not great but if you know what you want then shop hard and you will find it. It will certainly fill in half a day or more.
1999--01,Raghavendra Udupa,Unfortunately my visit to this place was in the morning less crowd and didn't experience the real malioboro road.  Amazing cleanliness
1998--01,Untoldwanderlust,This road is good enough if you're looking to buy some cheap clothes and sample some local street food. It's a long road but we found that each hundred metres are identical. Be wary of friendly men with great English offering to help you. They want to lure you to their stall
,Harrison J,You can find super cheap crafts in this street (after hard bargain). Shopping attraction for locals also so you can experience the business culture here
1997--01,ErMaia,If you are into collecting local Javanese trinket or simply any souvenirs of Yogya to bring back home this is your stop. Both side of the streets are packed with street vendors shops & sidewalk dining. Bring your best haggling skills & practice well. I simply love the side
1996--01,jamuna,They sell the same stuff everywhere. Good place to shop for bags and pouches. Lots of batik options.  Bargaining can go up to 60%. Was quoted 35K for a 5 in 1 pouch and another seller sold it at 15K each.

1995--01,c0ladashine,The area more enjoyable after 6pm. Good place to hunt for souvenirs at a reasonable price. Try to walk around before buying so you can get the best price! There is a big mall with some western shops and asian shops
1994--01,Yuki4by,Basically it's just a huge street market close to the Tugu station. There is a million of stall that sell a lot of touristy-looking sovenirs but after five minutes it becomes a bit of a blur because it's all the same stuff and there isn't really anything worth spending money
,jusso1969,Nice easy street to walk. Lots of shops that sell the same thing. Had trouble buying an umbrella in amongst the hundreds of batik shops. Just lacks variety.
1993--01,nryati D,Took a walk along this street to see local offerings such as batik local-print t-shirts and souvenirs at a bargain.  Travellers will get to appreciate the creativity of the locals through the designs and motives  displayed through their batik. You will be spoiled with so many
1992--01,Ale Claase,I think that couldn't say come to Yogyakarta if we don't step to Malioboro. All of the side of the road is full with souvenirs clothes food drink art painting even horse cart. All of the seller is really kind and polite. But be careful of your  luggage and wallet while you
,Dominikam1991,It is a lovely experience to wander around the street. You have loads of shops with souvenirs clothes batiks food and drinks. You can easily spend 2 hours simply walking down and browsing.
1991--01,weshter,Just a string of souvenir T-shirt stalls and very little else. If you're looking for a mall with a lot of clothes and batik you can visit here. In addition Street bands n other entertainers liven up the place
1990--01,hongkongmeyer,We went to Hamza Batik for shopping and found excellent batik and souvenirs. Good value and even local people go there for buying the best batik in town.
,Bryan H,I am not sure I get what all the fuss about. The traffic was horrible getting there and the same mob scene that had gripped all of Yogykarta had sunk into this street as well. Don't think it is worth it. The shops looked like they were selling a lot of junk that people think
1989--01,Ms Cas,Wear comfy shoes Malioboro Street is long and packed from one end to the other with stalls. The wares on sale can get a little repetitive mostly t-shirts and souvenirs but I didn't find the market sellers to be pushy or in your face to make a purchase - a nice change to other
1988--01,DeWandererSoul,its the famous street of Jogjakarta  with most of the hotels and shopping center surrounding this area Loved the sidewalk arrangements when the sunsets is completely turned into food street with various Indonesian dishes being served. on the other side there are so many small
,Yenyenyenyenyen,If u like Batik it's a heaven's paradise cos even though I am not a Batik person I find myself going crazy over the Colours variety and pricing of Batik pdts here!
1987--01,yayancarter,This unique market offer too many cute things to buy!! You can't just walk the street without buy something here. You need to check price to one another buyer before decided buying something.
1986--01,Sarah F,I have visited Malioboro Road in 2015. The place was crowded. Then I visited again in this new year still crowded but I love the sidewalk arrangements. I think more regularly. You can go shopping at Pasar Beringharjo and alongside Malioboro Road. Take a picture at Malioboro
,ekopenyo,Nowadays Malioboro is much more convenience. I enjoyed walking in there eventhough the other side still need improvement. Cleanlines anyhow still a problem. Pedestrian education is a must. Anyway great job Jogja 👍👍
1985--01,Garry K,We went there with our young children. It is very busy and alive. Unfortunately at night this road can be very crowded and not really suitable for young children. Good for shopping souvenirs however you need to know how to haggle.
1984--01,Lyana I,Those who really like shopping you can go this road.  Its full of shop and they open at 10am. You can find batik's begs sourviner and everything here.  There is a mall also at this road. When at night is full with local and tourist. Night view is very nice.  At the end of
,shernellt,Jogja is known for many touristic activities but you can’t visit this city without shopping on Malioboro street. If you’re like me and booked a hotel just a two-minute walk to this street then you’ll have a good shopping experience. There are shops and stores side by side and
1983--01,amphport,Sellers are very friendly. Best prices are at the southern end mainly south of Malioboro Mall. Wife bought a couple of necklaces from one place. The old lady at the stall gave her a discount without being asked for one. Then she bought two pairs of sandals. Again without
1982--01,Christophe Wybo,This street is one of the bussiest streets in Yogyakarta.  It's full of commerce!  Everyone seems to want to sell you something. So in search for some souvenirs?  Then this place is the place.  Don't forget to negotiate prices though.  Some say you can go down even to one third
,Diah S,A lot of sellers are here! My favorite one is Hannah Batik -used to be Mirota. But any sellers will do as long as you can have good price. The more you bargain the less price you'll surely have! :)
1981--01,Zaini,This place has become a must-visit for tourists you will find many thing about culture such as batik traditional toys accessories traditional food. But if you want go to Malang town ( beautiful places ) close to Bromo easier you can using train. Yogyakarta - Malang (6 hour)
1980--01,heggieNK,They renovate this street making it more walking friendly. Lot of chairs to sit when tired.  Lot of stalls and shops to see.  Beware of ersonal belongings. Ask to see the price first when ordering food street. There is a famously spring roll stall in front of samijaya
,RockPaperTravel,Interesting shopping street. Tons and tons of street stalls. Be prepared to bargain hard - I got most things at 1/4 of the first asking price. Insanely busy not a must do.

1978--01,puilin93,A place that has two rows of shops. You may shop there as there are fews batik shop and antics shops. Do not have high expectation. Overall its nice to pay a visit to walk around at night (not that hot) and there are lots of sitting areas to relax. Just 10 minutes walk (900m)
,Stuart E,This famous street is a must but hard to work down and you do get bothered by too many people that said there are a few nice shops n local food. Best to eat from stalls or kaki 5 while we took a bacek rickshaw to travel around it's the best option to take all in.
1977--01,ervanism,Heavy traffic jam arround Malioboro street. Better you park outside area than take a walk to that popular road in Jogjakarta when high season.
1976--01,SobSob87,very croweded on last december we can't enjoy the trip some pedesterian blind path broken  but it's ok because we arrive on long vacation in indonesia
,Fox_travelling,Like the oil gusher at Spindletop in 1901 the telecom towers rise above the city buildings like oil derricks in the oil rush years in Texas. And with it the businesses of the town flourish like on this very busy street full of families after sunset. Best place in town (in

1954--01,Amanda F,Good place to get a cheap feed that's not too far out of the way and gives one something to do in the evening. Browse the market stalls for knick knacks or souvenier trinkets then grab a bite while enjoying the lively ambience. I found my favorite street food here I discovered
,Danny Too,Many people may disagree with my ratings here but this is definitely one of my favourite spots in Yogyakarta. The place is constantly packed and expect a traffic jam each time you are here. However this place is so vibrant and you can expect lots of activities here. You can
1953--01,tes108,A great place to browse all the batik shops. I hate to see the skinny horses in the blazing sun pulling around  uncaring  tourists. Beware the men outside the shops touting the student art shows they establish a connection by coincidently having a relative studying in your

,Meltedja,Walking along the famous Malioboro Road has become a tedious journey for us. It was overcrowded and hot even in the evening. The road was filled with the same cheap looking t-shirts and batiks which they tried to sell as high priced as possible. It was not a pleasant experience.
1951--01,tajudin65,Be prepared to spend and bargain wisely. Do not easily get con with cheap low quality products.  Souvenir wise is vast and cheap too. Every 1st and 3rd Saturday nite there will have life band show by local singer.  Busiest street on weekend till midnight. Some shop even closed
1950--01,Karen J,I guess you have to see it but it gets old quick. The best way to see it is on the back of a Grab or Uber motorbike at night - a great cheap way to get the best night tour. If you’re walking around during the day beware of the guy that will inevitably come up to guide you to
,yanny,A long busy shopping street and they have seats along the pavement for people-watching or to relax; Malioboro Mal has quite a big decent supermarket. Along the streets shops are largely selling the same type of souvenirs so it gets repetitive after awhile. The shopkeepers are
1949--01,LilanWhardani,We can find lot of Batik here. If you buy Batik along the street you should bargain to get the best price. For the one who do not like bargaining you may go to Hamzah Batik.
1948--01,Arthur P,most off all this place is had an cultural surrounding.. malioboro road was incredible place but this place is so busy
,JoycFadjar,Yes there are a lot of famous places in Yogja but u are not here if u did not visit Malioboro Street.  Well for foreigners it might be a bit hard for u to bargain with the local street seller. But if u are looking for a better quality of batik & dont want to bother so much
1947--01,I_wander_asia,This street is a mad place full of food stalls clothing stalls horse riding street performance and just madness.   I wouldn’t buy anything here apart from food as the prices are quite inflated. We had some really great food here though. One time we tried pigeon and another we
1946--01,DjangoDjango,It all depends on what u expect. Yes it is very touristy and there are a lot of crappy tourist stalls selling the typical souvenirs. But besides that there it's a great place to have some nice street food and the street is very attractive in the evening when local musicians come
,ameyakamat,my rare Terrible review but having wasted precious 4 hours here i am compelled to. Unless you have decided to by costly sub standard Batik clothes by the kilo this is clear no go. There is are nearly no good food options in sight. too much traffic will make reaching there and
1945--01,NetjesHome,Awesome event for Yogyakarta's anniversary from 10.00PM-06.00AM with 10.000 free cups of coffee. There are 40 coffee shops who opened their booths infront of Malioboro Mall.

1943--01,Doug C,I feel like I’ve been to this exact same place all over Asia now. It is a bunch of souvenirs stands and restaurants mostly batik stores.  The vendors can get quite aggressive. And it is difficult to find a taxi out of here. The street food is quite tasty.
1942--01,Marius d,Three should be more and clear  sign boards.  Restaurants where you can have a beer are there but you need to search as they are hidden in side streets and dark alleys.  Shopping is so so not great. Rake a ride on the. 3 wheel motorcycle byt avoid the horse cars the horses
,Micko,All the things you want are here 1. a very busy street 2. the beastly pedestrian 3. various types of goods sold 4. a street atmosphere that is hard to find elsewhere 5. averall this is jogja

1940--01,Cileduk,Malioboro road is supposedly one of Jogyakarta's icons. It has been a couple of years that I avoided passing thru this road simply because of the anarchic motor drivers rickshaw/becak drivers and of course cars. So recently I thought I gave it a try again. So shocked...a wide
,Mike M,Its a pretty typical shopping strip but there are bargains to be found. The street has been remodeled to provide good safe pedestrian access. As always be pick-pocket aware! Especially look out for a little traditional batik gallery where student's and teachers' works are

1935--01,Audrie V,Didn't like Malioboro area at all! It's full of pushy street vendors youngsters trying to pickpocket you and cheap shops. In fact we moved hotels from Malioboro area to Prawirotaman area which is much nicer with plenty of cool bars good restaurants antique shops etc. It

,MassimoConsiglia,Business in Yogyakarta and need a break ? Walk on the beautiful Malioboro with its vendors and street coffee
1931--01,Gabrielle P,Malioboro Road was nice to see once but I wasn't enthralled with the idea of making it a nightly destination.  It was very crowded and full of all sorts of people from many different countries and cultures.  Probably a good place to be a little cautious with your wallet though
1930--01,Peter V,Title says it all really. Lots to do here the place to be. Also make sure you check out the many side streets!
,Emil N,Malioboro street is fun for people who wants to shop. It is super crowded and all the sellers has the same things. I wouldn't go again....
1929--01,Traveling with Kick scooter,Best place to buy local food and souvenirs. Fully packed at night and traffic is terrible. When you're driving scooter you have to go around in circles as it is one way
1928--01,Carol D,It was interesting to walk by and visit the shops and warnings however the traffic is very packed and it gets difficult to move by foot.
,Shyfullizan,A very easy road to navigate. It was a shopping paradise for shoppers. For those who are looking out for cheap local products which you can bargain Malioboro Road is the place to go. Very near hotels andmany things to shop.
1927--01,kimwan83,A nice walk leading to a large number of the sites to see in Jogja. A few metres from train station from Jakarta. Friendly locals and plenty of affordable eats as well as slightly higher budget restaurants although plenty more on side streets. Even more interesting at night

,Waqqas H,Every touristy city in Asia seems to have one of these: a street filled with little street-side peddlers selling the same 30 or so souvenirs. You can often find the same item being sold by about 20 sellers right next to each other.   I'll give you a tip: save your time. If you
1923--01,ameliacitra,unlike Tamansari you should visit Malioboro on weekends. Sometimes there's a parade. The atmosphere in Malioboro at the weekend is much more enjoyable
1922--01,Baligirl11,We were on a short trip to Yogyakarta and chose to stay near Malioboro Street based on our experiences from a previous trip. We were very disappointed.  We couldn't find anywhere to eat for a special dinner.  It is all just shops and hawker stalls with nighttime food stalls.
,LoveSunlight,A long street where you can experience life of local people. Most shops are selling cloths which Im not interested at all. Most food are local Indon food beside McD KFC and Starbucks. Some street performances were there to attract big crowd. I didn't shop for anything at all
1921--01,Yan Lian,Nothing special hanging out at Malioboro Road. A lot of street food but I not willing to try due to the food and cooking hygiene condition. And pls aware for the pick pocket.
1920--01,kowali s,A place where you should check quality of stitch.. same looking items could be found with higher quality and lower price. Perhaps prefer Beringharjo after hard bargains on Malioboro makes it easier in Beringharjo to get the goods at the right price. Also many crooks on
,kribang l,This is one of the buziest street in Jogja. This is the place where you can almost find and get whatever you want. Don't miss out the experience of riding on a trishaw & horse coach...

1917--01,Mathieu R,If you want to find souvenirs in Jogja there is a lot of better places to go. As tourists don't get caught in the batik painting scam. They approach you saying there is a festival of some sort and bring you to a place to buy paintings. Paintings are nice for the most but you
1916--01,Toma Sumarto H,The most lively and happening street in Yogyakarta the street is always busy with vehicles and all sort of peoples moving around. During the days the whole street full of activity you can see a lot of live musical performance by local group basking around. Once the sundown
,Jeanne E,The most famous shopping street in Jogja. Full of gifts souvenirs batik clothes etc. However you should haggle the price at least to half of it and you need to be more careful since it's very crowded. If you don't like shopping you can just sit on the newly renovated
1915--01,Riando,A beautiful area with awesome scenery nice to walk  but crowded. You can find more cheaper souvenirs here.
1914--01,keithlky,This is possibly the most happening street in Yogyakarta while it has a lot of stalls and shops they all sell similar items. You could however get some souvenirs here but I'll recommend to get them at proper souvenirs shops as the stall vendor tends to rip tourist money.
,Jennifer E,Mayne I just didn't go to the correct part but I really didn't like this street.   Beyond the selling of just cheap stuff for high prices they would hackle you nonstop  I would have men follow us for blocks it made me flight uncomfortable
1913--01,Rinny W,A Complete area to get low medium quality of Yogya souvenirs. Just make sure you know how to bargain.
1912--01,ruli,Nice road in jogja many improvmentclean and very nice sidewalksuite for all even for family with teenager...a goverment start to make green road here..great location!!!
,Bruce & Deb,It's one of those streets in the world where it's lined with street vendors and food carts. Then you a mall loaded with phones and gadgets. It's crazy busy and worth a few night visits to take it all in .
1911--01,Mahmuljinova,A cool place to spend an afternoon. Get lost in the local market and buy some traditional local suvenirs. Eat local food or go to Starbucks if your into something Western. A lot of food stands for the brave ones ride in a riksha or take pictures with the locals (because they

,ChrisLee146,Stay right at the centre of Malioboro street. Whole day the street is pack with humans cars motorbikes trishaw and horse carriage! At night be sure to try their local food along the road. Usually they set up around 4pm and ready around 5pm. Ordered a crab fried kangkong
1909--01,Phil C,First the positives it's lovely you can get any souvenir you fancy there are some very good buskers. But ultimately if you're not into shopping the incessant call of to batik 'gallery' can grate.
1908--01,Melinda S,The famous and authentic road in jogja is malioboro. Very busy street a lot of fabric or batik kiost along the street. On the night could be more crowded but still nice for just enjoy the street food and listen the street musician. Local people will look very busy with taking

,MemiMemole,I was surprised by all the negative reviews I had read on TA about Malioboro Road. IMO it definitely is not a tourist trap as some defined as you can just walk in and see how it is densely populated by locals (we passed by late night I guess in the day is even more so) who
1905--01,FBIT,Literally awful there was nothing of interest here at all. Just a string of souvenir T-shirt stalls and very little else. If you're looking for a mall you can visit here.

1901--01,DwayneDominic,For a city of this size name and tourists the street is rather disappointing. It offers more of the same and it’s a bit crowded. It’s fun to visit bit not for more than 10-20 minutes or so. At least this was the case for us. If you visit Yogyakarta then you should visit the
1900--01,Ansella,For me the one that interest the most is not the souvenirs shopping but the compilation of the street vendors with their selling items. The shops lining along the street from the Tugu station until in front of Vredeburg castle both side way. Some people might complain for the
,Ikin F,Here you can find many things that can you bring as a gift. This place sells many foods accessories clothes and many Jogja-things.
1899--01,Sebastien380,We went there on our first day in Yogyakarta expecting a busy commercial street with decent food outlets and bars. We only found shops selling knick-knacks and cheap clothing. As for restaurants we only saw food stalls on the side hotel f the street which I refused to try due

,Wilbert S,Hard to find a good/special restaurant pr a bar/café nearby. Especially when you are with little children.  A lot of shops sell the same things. Like in Europe: a shoppingstreet has more than one Zara's H&M  Only's Forever 21 and so on. Here it's only batikshops...
1897--01,ReviewBarracuda,It is a nice road to walk up and down and is an obvious must do while in the city. However it is a fairly standard street with the standard tourist shops and touts trying to sell you things you don't need.  While you are in the city definitely go here. But don't come to the
1896--01,SM80,We got a shuttle from our hotel to malioboro st to see what is the buzz is all about. There are several shops selling variety of items - batik key chain bags. As we passed from shop to shop I quickly realised it was almost the same things they were selling. Honestly I didn't
,Anu,We stayed just off Malioboro Road and whilst it has some restaurants and th me tourist information office I do not know why you would have a special visit to come to a road which is essentially selling tourist items such as t-shirts souvenirs horse and cart rides etc. There
1895--01,Michael K,You get what you expect fron the main tourist road. A lot of shops and fast food places and street parlors. Locals can be quite pushy here. It is worth a stroll but no much more.
1894--01,sarahmaiakerr,Nice but crowded and busy street lined wiyh vendors selling goods aimed at tourists.  Lots of crafts made with  lovely batik fabrics. Hard to tell what is authentic and what is 'tourist tat' but decent prices and good fun.
,Anmar68,Nice to see the little shops selling all kind of souvenirs. Bargain and you will have a good buy (and they still make money!).  Take a biker to drive you to your hotel quite an experience:  while everyone is moving in cars and on scooters the taxi drivers manage to being you
1893--01,lotus2b,I'd avoid it.  Shop after shop of the same old  I Love Jogja teeshirts lots of touts and a few scams.    Nonetheless nearby Sosrowijayan and its alleys have some great backpacker guest houses and restaurants serving Indo fare (Bedhots on Gang II for example).
1892--01,Robs_foodie,Malioboro Road is just a road of shop after shop of the same old touristy tat. We walked down out of interest but it's really a place you don't have to visit while in Jogja. Many people stop to talk to you about 'their cousin' or 'their sister' who lived in your home country to
,TartanCat57,I love it when people go shopping on these streets knowing they will be crazy and then complain. Go to the mall if you don't like street markets. During the day Malioboro Road is quite tame--early evening it is alright too. Sunday night was a zoo but that is why one goes. After
1891--01,Gary M,Not what it's cracked up to be really. Teeming with people and vehicles. Even going down side streets hazardous as cars and scooters force their way between stalls while slumbering rickshaw drivers lurk. Been to a lot of places with markets but crowds heat and fumes made it
1890--01,tjandra1,Watch your wallets and purses.  The boulevard gets very busy and crowded.  Hard to stay focused on finding things unless you have nothing better to do.  I would rather visit the boutique batik houses.
,Rebecca L,If you want to experience the real feel of a shopping street this is the place to be. Stalls line both sides of the streets but this is only the surface of the shopping. You have to be careful to not miss out on the hundreds of shops and stalls tucked behind those on the street.
1889--01,ClemensNi,Who really wants to get into Indo has to go to Malioboro in the late afternoon. It's crowded and you can try a lot of Indo food. You can also get a lot of souvenirs but every shop has pretty much the same.
1888--01,Prat DKan,Street food street performers clash of cultures - you will get all in the long and happening street of Yogyakarta. Do not miss it!

Malioboro street is the main street  the centre of the city .. in the
1886--01,Craig K,Very busy street our hotel was just nearby (dafam Fortuna). Lots of stalls which were not of particular interest to us but I guess depends on your taste.   Large mall (first in Jogja) on malioboro while lots of street food is available.
,Yun P,When I have doing business to Yogjakarta I also visited to Malioboro street. All of stuff is cheaper than I thought. It is very nice for indonesian people. Love it so much!
1885--01,Jay B,We had grand expectations this street would rival the likes of Koh San in Bangkok or Night Market in Siem Reap however we were disappointed. There are loads of stores selling T-shirts and Batik but thats it - the place really struggles with variety. Furthermore there were no
1884--01,Willem v,I was surprised how busy things were these days in Yogya and how many things have changed since our last visit 17 years ago.  But the Jl. Malioboro is still as it used to be with lost of local traffic stalls and people. A pleasure to walk :-)!  Buy some local food cloths
,Astrid P,I love being here to look for traditional or typical jogja souvenirs with reasonable price. The nuance of traditionality is strong here with local sellers and stalls along the street sometimes with local music. I love the handmade items here. It answers your souvenirs needs!
1883--01,Laura C,It's a good place to hang out and find inexpensive stuffs. As long as you can manage walking long distance.
1882--01,elvinchoo86,The town for Yogyakarta with dozens of hawkers selling their handicrafts and souvenirs to the tourists. Try to bargain with them to get the best rate.
,AlitcadWahyudi,Nowdays malioboro have better sidewalk lot of chair for resting and free bikes for rent just give your ID to the staff. The local shop along the way more organized.
1881--01,69belle,If you like markets in general looking for souvernirs with a good price (that is if you know how to bargain) this is a good place! But for my personal taste it is toooo crowdy! And really hot so I normaly dont spend more than 1 hour here I recommend you to avoid high seasons
1880--01,Indiga C,I came to Malioboro on a Monday evening and found it to be quite lively. To all the reviewers who complain about it being crowded and full of cheap knick knacks – it is a SE Asian shopping street you will find this kind of place in every Asian country. On one side of the street
,shinydugong,Malioboro is a place you must visit if youre planning on buying a lot of cheap stuff there are tons of options and you would be shocked in what you can find.
1879--01,Febry_Liang,Whenever you want to eat on Malioboro street ask for price before you eat !!! so you wont get shock after but have to pay anyway.  Nice to have a long walk & doing some window shopping or shopping (must bargain!) until you get tired & you can have ronde (ginger drink with
1878--01,Gauthier G,If you dont know what to do at night in yogja and want visit this is a good place. Lots of shops possibility to try horses transport eat some snacks... You can find your souvenirs there easily but negotiate all prices. For a foreigner it is more than double of the price. By
,70cyl,Was not particularly impressed with this night market - maybe we missed something but mostly stalls selling cheap clothes. Didn't notice any interesting arts and crafts items.     Other night markets in SE Asia are far more fun - Bangkok Luang Prabang Siem reap!
1877--01,Fifi I,Malioboro nowadays is not very friendly to pedistrian especially in the night. Very crowded people littering .. smoke polution and garbage piles is everywhere. The food price also bit crazy and they often take advantage to tourist. Make sure to check the price first.
1876--01,Lone T,If you like shopping this place is good. Not much else to say about it. Easy to get a bechak. Heavy bargain is necessary.
,Melissa S,honestly I'm not sure what people like so much about this street.  It is extremely crowded and most of the shops only offer knicknaks and other like items.  We walked down it once to check it out but that was it.
1875--01,Traveltheworldmate,We travel around the world and have seen this many times already. Cheap clothes a lot of souvenirs but for us way too crowded.  Good if you have nothing to do and youre looking for souvenirs/clothes  But you dont miss something if you cant make it there.
1874--01,ashwin p,As one of the icon of yogyakarta you can find lots of street vendors here.  Pros: cheap Lots of trinkets clothes even foods.  Cons: you need to haggle sometimes Always crowded
,Margaretha,If this is your first time in Jogja i suggest you visit this place. It is a good place to buy stuffs as long as you are not afraid to bargain. Seriously you need to bargain especially if you are tourists from abroad. Be careful with thieft too. And make sure you don't accept
1873--01,JoM2S,A nice to have on your trip if you haven't seen a crowded street with horses and the traditional bikes them go have a walk it's nice to people watch and see how the locals shop and sell we went there and just lines he colorfulness of the place
1872--01,chandra-wida,I went there in Ramadhan (fasting month) but the food stalls opened even in the midday.  I prefer to buy batik from the bigger shop than from the street vendors. The price may be higher but I trust the quality. Pramartha and Aditya Batik are my favorite so far.  We may go to
,FelixSH,Good location for spending your days with shopping and dining. Also the traditional horse-cart and richsaw. Well maintained road for pedestrian horses and cars.
1871--01,bluemocha,Family and I had the chance to walked on this road during our tour. In a late afternoon  We walked a small stretch of about 2 thousand feet on both side of the street near Malioboro mall and search for soeveniors at several stores. Place was noisy busy crowded and smelly
1870--01,Pohan Liem,Pros: - open day and night - downtown - many things to offer - some good food - friendly pedestrian - so many improvement  Cons: - too crowded sometime - the parking lot is far away  But...still worth to visit😊

1599--01,Joy M,Ugh it was so packed. We could barely walk on the sidewalks dodging horse drawn carriages and rickshaws. I guess there's some good shopping to be found but nothing that we were looking for. I suppose it's a place that's pretty central to Jogja but once was enough for me!

,ecclesia9,Crowded with people squeezing back to back.  Stuffing hot.  Cheap stuff (basically the same stuff with the same price same quality) every step you walk.    Not a place to go with elderlies and young children.  But it is indeed the heart of the town for some reasons.  Oh there

1573--01,SheonLo,If you expect great food fantastic shopping and soaking up jogja culture you're in for a great disappointment. Batik scammers roam the shop corridors preying on foreigners the whole street reeks of horse manure and street food is FILTHY! I have quite a tolerance for street
1572--01,Nungki G,if you are a shopaholic with traditional taste this shopping street is perfect for you. Take a stroll at this street you will find batik (different shapes and sizes) souvenirs and traditional foods. Most of the price at the street stall is negotiable you are always welcome
,Miguel V,This market is very bad it runs for many blocks but the clothing articles or souvenirs are always the same in every row. And very poor quality. I was looking for a hat and the hats they were selling were the same for all vendors on any block very bad quality too. The markets

1567--01,Aaron,Famous street in Yogyakarta with hundreds (I think) of stalls selling various things such as batik and accessories. This street didn't do much for me probably because I was backpacking and didn't wanna waste much money. But if you're a huge shopper you may have found a

1561--01,wshapr,I bought some souvenir here that have Yogja logo. We only spent less than 3 hours here due to insufficient time. You may not find Borobudur or other tourist attraction  symbol/logo in this place. Each tourist attraction has its own souvenir nearby that area. If you interested in
1560--01,PriscillaCPL,This street is at the edge of the tourist hub between Jalans Sosrowijayan and Dagen near the Tugu railway station.

1557--01,Suk Pei L,Was here to see what does this famous street in Jogja has to offer. However I only get to see the street was lined with cart-pulling horsies and stalls with no locals visiting. A nasi goreng which normally costs only around Rp 8k-10k can goes up to Rp 17k-27k at Jln Malioboro
1556--01,Aprilliya,It is just street But a lot of people sale something there What i don't like is they are doesn't care about garbage Is very dirty every where
,Yap W,Is just a street with shops selling local souvenirs to tourists i.e. sarongs (hand painted fabric) which are cheap compared to Malaysia or even other parts of Indonesia. But personally from my view Jogjakarta is not famous for sarongs in Indonesia. It is Pekalongan on the other
1555--01,Edou87,Not a lot of positive here. I liked the walk in this animated place buts thats it. Small shops selling all the same low quality non authentic stuff. Buildings are covered with cheap commercial. If you have too much time its ok to check it out but dont make it a must see...
1554--01,Nogafever,Very lively and fun night market. It's quite long and takes a long time to walk. However the stuff they sell at the night market are all the same types of stuff you only need to visit a few stands. Definitely try the street food if you are an adventurous traveler might not be

1553--01,Mannlee,A visit to Yogjakarta is not complete if you don't step foot on Jalan Maliobori. Its a vibrant street. The festive atmosphere from evening to late night keeps you awake too. There's lots to do here. The street stalls sell pretty tasty food like soto ayam Indonesian Gado-gado

,Beeasa W,It's a place where you can find amost anything you need. Being in the heart of Yogyakarta close to Kraton train station Tugu the landmark of Yogyakarta and some other attractions it's literally the busiest part of the city. If you can't stand crowded places better avoid

1547--01,Jakub O,Very crowded in the evening. All shops are similar and sell almost the same thing. When it comes to batik mafia we were told 3 days in a row that there is batik exhibition and it is the last day to see it! Every day was the last day... and their batik is told to be fake one.
1546--01,starry_sunshine,Although this is the place where you can buy cheap items for souvenir it can be pretty crowded too. Most of the people in jogja doesn't speak english so its very hard to get directions especially when haggling and buying stuff. Its more of a miss than a hit.
,Clara G,We passed along all the shops thousands of times during our visit to Yogyakarta as we stayed in a hotel in Sosrowijayan but we never had time to buy nothing. Now we regret it because we tried to buy souvenirs in other places like Jakarta and they're difficult to find and

1543--01,Thaddaeus K,What they sell: Cheap t-shirts with materials that would last you a few wash in the machine paintings many souvenir snacks shop batik shirts small statues.   Critique: All reasonably priced but lacking of variety as vendors sell the same item as the vendor a few stalls away.
1542--01,Sophie G,This lines the whole length of the famous malioboro street and can be quite daunting if experienced first into your trip. However these vendors are quiet not pushy or harassing our at all rude like others we have experienced.  Prices appear reasonable and there are some lovely

1541--01,Brooklynite_Abroad,This is the epicenter of Yogyakarta and is much lauded.  If you are well traveled you will be sorely disappointed as Molioboro is nothing but a chaotic boulevard swarmed with people shopping at cheap nondescript shops and tons of fast food.   There are also large hotels

1536--01,Southernqt72,This is a defnate must do as it gives a glimpse into the life of the local people.  Most of the items sold are cheap.  But if you are in to batik this is the place for you!  There are some antique stores with unique items but I would ask your hotel to take you to the homes
,Daniel W,You will find a lot of things with cheap price! You can also eat a lot of food with good price. Please spend at least half day to enjoy the shopping experience! Don't forget some shops close at 9 pm. So what are you waiting for? Hurry!
1535--01,Reytia A,Too crowded for me but some of the pengamen/street singer are awesome. A lot of street food to try. Got a good price with becak and andong (maybe because my husband can speak javanese so do learn some helpful phrases). Shop some stuff at mirota batik as i dont like haggling.
1534--01,David S,I know that I stand out in a crowd being a very tall Canadian at 6'4 makes me a bit of a spectacle. But the level of people stopping me taking my picture one of which occurred inside a washroom along Malioboro made me resent my trip. I was never left to just enjoy the
