2016,Lanyp,We want to enjoy night walks at Braga street but it was definitely not possible. Everywhere was full of teenagers smoking and cigarettes trash all over the place. There also a lot of places that seems like a cheap kind of night club. This is certainly not a place for family or
2016,inascully,This is another interesting street in Bandung other than Asia-Afrika. With lots of restaurants/cafes definitely the best spot for tourists & local youngsters to hang out. The cafes are mostly western orientated. We bought mini cakes from Sugar Rush cafe & pastries (not far from

2015,SendyFilemon,This area is somewhat revamped to enable the arcade walk to come bustling to live. I think it's just an effort to recreate a world that exist many decades ago sprinkled with some ridiculous ideas of entertainment and then sold it to local and international tourist.   Good if

2015,NashMaxoriyapompuss,Seems like a very promising place to visit from the pictures you see online but it's nothing more than a street with sidewalks.  Bandung is a very disappointing city to visit.
2015,VRMajabavisdimi,Nice place to visit after dawn. Walk along the street enjoying the old buildings. I like the new street lights. Braga should be car free in the evening as to give people more space to enjoy it.

2015,DanielP,This is one of the street that is still kept to the original heritage of Bandung of the past. This place is near the Asia-Africa Museum so it is a good stopping place when you are on your journey to this place.  I have been here quite often but I always have been during the
2014,Jean-MarcR,I have gone along Jalan Braga quite a few times but always in daytime. Maybe it's a good night spot but in daytime you will never get anything extraodinary there. Lots of art places but with repetition of styles. Lots of eating and drinking places but I did not find any

,monjunee,The street is not a really long street to walk. It was made of paving blocks to keep the authentic atmosphere there. There are many cafe and restaurants there. I recommend you to try the braga permai it is a very good restaurant but the best time to visit this restaurant is in
,HansSolo72,I don't think I can come up with more idiotic action even if I wanted to. The city is upgrading the both sides of sidewalk on Jalan Braga. Finally somebody cares for the pedestrians right? WRONG it's all in the name of 60th anniversary of the Asia Africa conference. And the
2014,JamesB,Talking about retro art and photos you have to go to this street. There are so many restaurants art shop with historical architectures all around the place. Can't say i'm satisfied went to this street but i'm not that disappointed too. Average tourism objects if you want

2015,MarionA,They are currently fixing the sidewalks.  What this means is that it's not only difficult to walk on those sidewalks (they stripped the old paving) it can be downright dangerous since there are many loose and/or broken tiles lying around (yes they plan to cover the

2014,fabiolafirsa,Looking for an old traditional home made ice cream..really enjoy the the atmosphere of jalan Braga..
2015,pixiedub,If you enjoy art deco and colonial architecture Jalan Braga is definitely worth a stroll through.   There was a market that had a top floor full of antiques and vintage stuff which is also worth walking through if you like vintage. Didn't ask for prices though so am not sure
2015,BabaJ,Some good food here but otherwise I would not bother. This is a past it's prime type place. If you are into the bar scene there are several open air style bars here.
2014,HYJ10,Jalan Braga is the older settlement of the Bandung city. The architectures around the area have strong western colonial influence and some businesses occupying these old buildings take full advantage of the vintage feel by incorporating retro interior to enhance the ambiance.
2014,ReginaP,The street isn't for pedestrian. Cars and motorcycle are packed the street. The street is quite good with vintage atmosphere. I went to a culinary night there and food are everywhere. It's worth to visit.

,JosephWong,Pavement under construction (as at Feb 2015) with uncovered manhole. Just a few restaurant & cafes line up in a 500 meters street with old buildings. Not a happening area.
2014,Andi,This classic street is the best place to enjoy the old city of Bandung. Good place for photo shoots. The street has long been planned to become a pedestrian but never realized. Thus the stone paveway has become useless since it is still heavily used by car traffic. Some never
2014,AfifahV,i always enjoy jalan braga as it sbone of heritage in bandung. The atmosphere was good unique place
2014,db9x,I love the ambiance sadly you should enjoy the traffic in busy hours. it should be get more attention from the government to make it more enjoyable for tourist. it would be a perfect place if there is no car or motorcycle allowed to pass this street. still wanna come back tho.
2014,fr4nc1sc4,I would prefer if the street is for pedestrian only. No car or motorcycle allowed. That could bring different deeper  atmosphere to the street... and bring out the best of what it is expected from the 'classic' street... where old settings of places to eat and hang out are
2014,SurfingWild,Braga should be one of the highlights of Bandung with it's paved street and historical buildings. But apart from a few stores art shops antique dealers Wimpy and a couple of very old cafes it seems run down. I think the Mayor of Bandung needs to give Jalan Braga a facelift
2015,Lovetravelkusuma,frankly speaking this area is really lively whether day or night you say..... very bright with full traffic one way flow just need to be carefull if need to cross the road. lots of eatries and 24hrs alfamart something like 7Eleven which is 24hrs... alone goes the pubs/clubs

2015,PatchFamily,Jalan Braga buildings have nice architectures the Dutch used to live here in the olden time.  Now the strip is full with eateries and shops.
2014,TravelerO,Small mall on Jalan Braga there afew stores inside and some restaurants along with a cinema. Nothing special to see or do. Ok for a quick stop to eat but beyond that your time would best spent elsewhere in the city. The bigger malls are better such as Bandung Indah Plaza
2014,marthaulina,the mall is small & nothing interesting. if you want to go window shopping or just wasting time don't come to this mall. the cinema is ok.
2014,MilkaNoviatiB,Just a regular walk in the afternoon not fit for little children they get tired easily they're not too excited as we the parents to walk on the street

,CS_Tan289,The whole street was under constructio during my visit.   The dusk and smoke were horrendous.   This plave is overrated for now and should be avoided.
2014,Aaron_HeC,Number of pubs and clubs along the streets. but pretty dead at around 12am. Some restaurants and cafés here like sugarush and convenient stores. Police will be around at night to maintain order in case of nuisance drinking party-goers. Street is still under reconstruction and
2014,7Zebra,There were many restaurants ( Chinese Japanese Western Local  Fast Food art galleries retailsshops and a Braga City Walk Mall with many shops and a cinema.  But the pavements are now under construction so becareful while walking along the street as the traffic was heavy.
,RianaS,Jalan Braga is well known for its heritage. Where you could find old coffee shops along jalan Braga especially during weekend they also offer live music. They just wider the pedistrian path so it makes more convinience to have an evening walk.
2014,HardyY,the street is under rehabilitation along the way from the north side to the south one at daylight this brings crowded and traffic jam when rainy day comes pedestrian must be walk through carefully
2014,LIM640201,There is a souvenir shop opposite Aston Hotel which sell reasonably priced souvenirs. Note that 'Harga Pas' notice in this shop means fixed price.
2014,FrancisLee,I do not even know why this is a place to stay and see I was deceived into staying in this area! For goodness sake stay in the cihampelas area! It is made worse that the drainage work is currently being overhaul along this street! Walking here is hell! The cars and motorcycle
2014,JerryJCH,Braga is closer to Alun-Alun and if you want to visit a karaoke club there are some here just outside the Braga City Walk (Mall). There is also Braga Twenty One (Braga 21) a cinema on 2nd floor of the Mall.
,farizaziz77,Saw maybe a dying drug addicts on my night walk through the jalan braga.  Not so safe there to walk alone
2014,Yangtseguy,Where have they been? For sure not in Bandung or Braga. Bandung lost all flair and fascination it once got. No more sidewalks but open unsecured  holes combined with mud and dirt everywhere - not only in Braga. The Jakarta tourists jamming the city from friday to sunday to see
2014,ResintaN,I'm proudly review this street as a happy resident of Bandung. Jalan Braga is one of the interesting place  yet the humble one to visit in this city. It is basically one of the oldest street in Bandung that offers you culinary and entertaiment. One of my favorite. I prefer to
2014,BudiPrasetyo,Formerly Jalan Braga was interesting and romantic place but now at both sides of the road are undergoing construction it's difficult for pedestrian to walk along the road while the road is busy.  May be will be different if the undergoing construction is completed.
2014,TriSepdian,Nothing much to expect a street not too long less than 1km with a Paris vibe around. Yea its got some nice shops a clean sorrounding (for indonesia's street its still rare) but thats all. I still prefer to go to mall  or jalan dago or jalan riau for shopping.
2014,WendyTravel2012,We went there in the afternoon a few days ago.  This is a busy road.  In addition both sides of the road are undergoing reconstruction of the footpaths and it makes walking along the road rather difficult as you have to avoid the vehicles and motorcycles as you walk.
2014,L046,This one-way street has drainage construction along and looked like a cowboy street. It is surrounded by mainly restaurants and bars. At night it's packed with beggars young clubbers bar lovers. For shopping i only saw one poloraft shop at one corner.
2014,JenniferD,On the sections I travelled I found all the buildings to be old and dirty and in a great need of repair...it did not help with both sides of Jl Braga being dug up to install sewerage or storm culverts / drainage...all the earth works had been piled into the road leaving little
2014,DianneB,This area will be a major tourist spot in the future but at present is undergoing footpath works. I could see it as a mall closed off from vehicles in the future
2014,Nananunu,The street actually reminds me of streets in Bali. The cafes were beautiful. Well some of them. But I think if the street were closed for cars. It would be more beautiful.
2014,rizalt,Yes I live in Bandung and I was born here. Such a sad thing to see that this nostalgic road covered with a lot of commercial board electricity wire and a lot of things that covering the beauty of the road's scenery. I wish the government give more appreciation about this not
2014,benkoh9531,Visited earlier the place was packed/crowded/noisy and under massive renovation for a new drainage system I think. At least 70% of the shops had their shutters closed.   Absolutely no business here for the average shopper...Braga walk was terribly empty as well other than a
,sugiphang,It my second times stay at Braga street and I still loves this area many gallery and photography. So I think this is an art street. Or you can enjoy your coffee from couple coffee shop.
2014,agentjade,You could tell it's a historical street that has seen better days. When we went to Braga Permai on this street they have pictures of the Dutch colonial days in the early 1920s when the facades were gleaming and posh cars lined the street.  Today it was sadly in need of a
2014,AhFaii,Very Windy Place with lots of university students nice old colonial buildings alot of eateries to choose from theres Gold gym there nightlife is good as there are lots of local acts there would be a recommended place to chill in the cool evening.
2014,mohsyah,very nice spending all night on the Braga road enjoy a cup of coffee with my family but along Braga road too crowded and jammed.
2014,VgenV,Nice place to Hang out for Bar and Cafe  but now just open until 24.00 not 24 Hours.  but u still can walk around just for foto or another. seeking beer u can go to small store near of mie kocok  or u can ask the parking man there..
2014,DonnyJ,The was once famous for its unique buildings in one street might be only a history. The road kind of bumpy and many buildings are closed. Some famous restaurant like Braga Permai still in here and one of the reason to visit this street.   Two famous five stars hotels are
2014,tansui,The so called Braga Walk is a big letdown.  Nothing much as compared to Chihampelas Walk.  The only special is the art vendors along this street.
2014,TongdeL,A lot of the shops are closed even on weekends. Only 2 to 3 crowded discos and restaurants. There are some street peddlers selling clothes and paintings.
2014,SingingBelly,Maybe it's interesting because there are so many old style bakery. That aside I guess this road has nothing to offer. Many of the buildings are not occupied anymore.
2014,geoffc,It is a little bit tired and old and many prostitutes. But there are good restaurants and niteclubs. In Braga Walk ( a mall) there are 2 hotels restaurants and movie cinemas.Also 2 Karaoke places
2013,EmergingMarketSkptc,I stayed for a week or so at Chez Bon Hostel on JL Braga late last year and the street has clearly seen better days but there is enough traffic through the area to keep enough interesting restaurants open and I guess things will get better when more shops open in Braga Citywalk
2014,wanglimei,I went to this art and souvenir shop called sin sin opposite the old gas place which is a very nice building.  Too bad it is not used. Found very high quality and unique Indonesian art work at sin sin with good price. Also lots of silver earrings and necklaces with very
2014,Ktgoo,Lots of local painting at cheap and bargain prices. Must try the local drink Avocado juice. Short street but with a lots of food that worth trying
2014,JeanAndriesS,Ideal for a leasure walk day and night. A range of restaurants nearby for any kind of food. May be the music all around a Little bit too loud.
2014,JessicaJ,You can find pub bar restaurant cinema. this st could make you feel like home (European/American)
2014,nuningloft,I was stay in this area for 1 night 2 days. Many car in this street so we can not easily cross the road. A lot of traffic light can not work properly in this area. Hmm.. totally different with my city. In Braga street we can find a lot of paintings shop coffee club with an
2014,jonytt,Was excited to visit this place after reading good reviews of it. I DID read the bad reviews but decided that perhaps it was just not their cup of tea and that so many people who rated this place highly could not be wrong... WELL they were! Seriously people the place could not
2014,hesterpamela,Found local talented painters. Street is filled with colonial buildings. You will find old bakery (been there since 1930 or something). Atmosphere is artsy and humble classic and pretty.   Recommended to visit if you are looking for the classic side of Bandung
2014,liekebos93,Great and vibrant in the evening to enjoy some food and a drink but crowded and busy with cars during the day. Also didn't see spectacular architecture.
